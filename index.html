      <h2>The Overview</h2>
      <p>
         My name is Todd Trivisonno.<br>
         Each week, I'll be documenting my progress through a web developer bootcamp offered by Awesome Inc. in Lexington, Kentucky.<br>
         After ten years of working full-time in the outdoor recreation industry, I'm excited to be learning a whole new skillset. Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be able to combine my experience and passion for the outdoors with the tech world.

      <h3>Prework Week 1</h3>
         <h4>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h4>
         <p>
            I knew the very first week was going to be a difficult one due to a combination of factors. I was still working full-time and in the midst of our busiest season. I learned a great deal in the intro web development class I took in the spring, but since that finished in April I had done a grand total of zero coding. I have three children under the age of 5. And I was (still am?) wrestling with whether I should be quitting my job and jumping into an intimidating new field.<br>

            I felt quite decided about starting the bootcamp, so I was surprised to be feeling hesitant about the first meetup. A big factor was meeting the other folks joining me in this endeavor. I tried to manage my expectations, but ultimately I knew what I was looking for in classmates; mainly, people that I could trust have the same commitment and motivation to excel through this course. After the first meetup, honestly, it was a bit hard to tell. Our time was so short together and we hardly had time to talk so I couldn't really get a sense of people's motivations. I left wishing I knew more, but thankful that I have a great friend committed to the class, and telling myself it's just day 1, give it time. I should say now, in hindsight, we are still very early in the class but it's evident this is a hardworking group. I'm probably the last person to get their blog started! I blame the kids.<br>

            Overall, though, the first week did meet my expectations and I'm glad it started semi-light before getting thrown into the deep-end. I'm also very happy I took the intro course!
         </p>
         <h4>What are you struggling with?</h4>
         <p>
            From a technical standpoint, I'm feeling okay with the prework week 1 material. I know I'm only using a fraction of what Git can do, but I feel comfortable with the basics and that the basics are really the bulk of Git's function. I struggle with wanting to really dig in and get comfortable with the material, but until the full-time job is wrapped up, it will be tough to find the time.
         </p>
         <h4>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h4>
         <p>
            Call it excited, or moreso nervous, but I see javascript approaching quickly and I'm definitely anticipating it. I struggled quite a bit with it during the intro course, but we didn't have much time. I'm looking forward to really spending more time with it. Also the prospect of writing code to make a game of my choosing has got my inner-child very excited.

      <h3>Prework Week 2</h3>
         <h4>What are your thoughts on Pseudocoding?</h4>
         <p>
            I really like the idea of pseudocoding. In practice, it's more difficult than I would have expected. It's really easy to get into the weeds with every single little detail, which at some point seems to defeat the purpose. But I think with some feedback and continued practice, it will be an essential tool for me in conceptualizing code. 
         </p>
         <h4>What are you struggling with?</h4>
         <p>
            Right now I'd like to spend more time on CSS. I've seen what CSS is capable of and I feel like I'm very far from unlocking it's potential. So far I've really enjoyed styling pages, but then I find myself still struggling with the basic syntax.
         </p>
         <h4>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h4>
         <p>
            Speaking of CSS, I'm eager to do more styling! I enjoy drawing out concepts and I'm looking forward to making more of those drawings a reality.

      <h3>Prework Week 3</h3>
         <h4>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and Javascript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</h4>
