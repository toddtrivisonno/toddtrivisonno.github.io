         <h2>The Overview</h2>
         <p>
            My name is Todd Trivisonno.<br>
            Each week, I'll be documenting my progress through a web developer bootcamp offered by Awesome Inc. in
            Lexington, Kentucky.<br>
            After ten years of working full-time in the outdoor recreation industry, I'm excited to be learning a whole
            new
            skillset. Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be able to combine my experience and passion for the outdoors with
            the
            tech world.
         </p>
         <br>
         <h3>Prework Week 1</h3>
         <h4>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</h4>
         <p>
            I knew the very first week was going to be a difficult one due to a combination of factors. I was still
            working
            full-time and in the midst of our busiest season. I learned a great deal in the intro web development class
            I
            took in the spring, but since that finished in April I had done a grand total of zero coding. I have three
            children under the age of 5. And I was (still am?) wrestling with whether I should be quitting my job and
            jumping into an intimidating new field.<br>

            I felt quite decided about starting the bootcamp, so I was surprised to be feeling hesitant about the first
            meetup. A big factor was meeting the other folks joining me in this endeavor. I tried to manage my
            expectations, but ultimately I knew what I was looking for in classmates; mainly, people that I could trust
            have the same commitment and motivation to excel through this course. After the first meetup, honestly, it
            was
            a bit hard to tell. Our time was so short together and we hardly had time to talk so I couldn't really get a
            sense of people's motivations. I left wishing I knew more, but thankful that I have a great friend committed
            to
            the class, and telling myself it's just day 1, give it time. I should say now, in hindsight, we are still
            very
            early in the class but it's evident this is a hardworking group. I'm probably the last person to get their
            blog
            started! I blame the kids.<br>

            Overall, though, the first week did meet my expectations and I'm glad it started semi-light before getting
            thrown into the deep-end. I'm also very happy I took the intro course!
         </p>
         <h4>What are you struggling with?</h4>
         <p>
            From a technical standpoint, I'm feeling okay with the prework week 1 material. I know I'm only using a
            fraction of what Git can do, but I feel comfortable with the basics and that the basics are really the bulk
            of
            Git's function. I struggle with wanting to really dig in and get comfortable with the material, but until
            the
            full-time job is wrapped up, it will be tough to find the time.
         </p>
         <h4>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h4>
         <p>
            Call it excited, or moreso nervous, but I see javascript approaching quickly and I'm definitely anticipating
            it. I struggled quite a bit with it during the intro course, but we didn't have much time. I'm looking
            forward
            to really spending more time with it. Also the prospect of writing code to make a game of my choosing has
            got
            my inner-child very excited.
         </p>
         <br>
         <h3>Prework Week 2</h3>
         <h4>What are your thoughts on Pseudocoding?</h4>
         <p>
            I really like the idea of pseudocoding. In practice, it's more difficult than I would have expected. It's
            really easy to get into the weeds with every single little detail, which at some point seems to defeat the
            purpose. But I think with some feedback and continued practice, it will be an essential tool for me in
            conceptualizing code.
         </p>
         <h4>What are you struggling with?</h4>
         <p>
            Right now I'd like to spend more time on CSS. I've seen what CSS is capable of and I feel like I'm very far
            from unlocking it's potential. So far I've really enjoyed styling pages, but then I find myself still
            struggling with the basic syntax.
         </p>
         <h4>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h4>
         <p>
            Speaking of CSS, I'm eager to do more styling! I enjoy drawing out concepts and I'm looking forward to
            making
            more of those drawings a reality.
         </p>
         <br>
         <h3>Prework Week 3</h3>
         <h4>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and Javascript play in the process of rendering content
            and
            providing user experience?</h4>
         <p>
            The metaphor that has resonated with me the most was what Gary, my Intro to Web Development instructor,
            shared
            with us concerning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>
            He compared HTML to building the foundation and structure of a house. It is the general framework, you can't
            have a house without it, but it's also going to be a very plain house if that's all it is.<br>
            CSS acts as the accents that can really make a house pop. It can be the basic paint on the walls, but it can
            also be highly skilled woodworking or craftsmanship built into all the details. css turns a plain structure
            into something much nicer to look at and easier to navigate.<br>
            Now you have built a structurally sound house and added much needed character, but as it stands, the house
            could be from the 21st century or the 12th century. Addind Javascript to your content is like adding
            electricity. Or adding all the fun and useful stuff in your house. It gives power to that nice looking
            structure.<br>
            Just as a house needs structure, paint, and power, the modern internet user expects a website with well
            designed HTML, CSS, and Javascript even if they don't know how it works.
         </p>
         <br>
         <h3>Prework Week 4</h3>
         <h4>What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in Prework? What was
            helpful?
            What hindered your progress? How did you overcome challenges?
         </h4>
         <p>
            We've covered several major topics during Prework, all topics that could easily fill an entire bootcamp on
            their own. These are Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>
            Git: At first Git is seemingly formless, and as a person who strongly relies on visuals, it makes it very
            difficult to grasp it's structure and flow. Going through this a second time though, helped solidify it's
            function a lot more. Having more time to pick Justin and Ian's brains on exactly how and when I should push,
            pull, create branches, etc has made a huge difference. Also learning about gitk and visual representations
            on
            GitHub really helped! <br>
            GitHub: I really liked how much we interacted with GitHub during Prework because it gave me the repetitions
            to
            make it sink in and we spent time working through all the links. I still think GitHub can feel cluttered in
            it's visuals, but understanding better all the things it can do helps significantly. Working through the
            Mozilla learning modules with the bot was particularly helpful in getting lots of reps. <br>
            HTML/CSS: I'll group these two together because my feelings on both are similar. Covering these really felt
            like a blur. Thankfully I felt comfortable manipulating these based on experience in the intro course.
            Enevitably I still get hung up, but I'm getting better at thinking of the right questions to ask to find a
            solution. Something that has resonated with me from the intro class is writing code semantically. Writing
            purposeful, organized code has made a huge difference in avoiding creating bigger problems for myself. <br>
            Javascript: And then there is Javascript. So much to like, so much that makes me want to bang my head on the
            table. I like that you can seemingly do anything with Javascript. I hate that you can seemingly do anything
            with Javascript. That's really been my biggest challenge so far, sifting through the many ways to solve a
            problem and selecting a path to do so. The HackerRanks have been very helpful for providing manageable sized
            problems, and when solved are giving me a much needed confidence boost. The biggest thing I'm working on is
            changing my thinking to operate like a computer. Pseudocode, which probably deserves it's own section in
            this
            blog, has been tremendously helpful in helping me. I was pretty resistent to it at first, and just wanted to
            start typing, but I've experienced first hand how big a difference it makes to start with pseducoding first.
         </p>

         <h3>In-class Week 1</h3>
         <h4>What did you learn about that helped you understand more about Design?</h4>
         <p>
            Apax Software's lead on design, Jacqueline, came and spoke to our class for a little over an hour on
            Wednesday.
            She introduced to a very simple and effective method for creating and determining good design. Called
            <em>inappropriately</em> CRAP design. Or Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity.<br>
            Contrast refers to the importance of having elements standout by using contrast. Contrast can be used in
            fonts,
            sizing, texture, color...you name it. <br>
            Repetition of colors, patterns, and elements help emphasize the focus of the design. Placing repetitive
            elements in the same location is recommended.<br>
            Alignment refers to how elements are placed. Having an element just slightly out of alignment can greatly
            effect a person's perception of the page. For example using the visual center, where your eye naturally
            assumes
            the center is, versus the precise geometric center can be much more pleasing to the eye.<br>
            Proximity stresses clear communication over 'neat' design. Grouping like elements and paying attention to
            the
            amount of whitespace between elements can greatly influence a design. Jacqueline recommended grouping
            similar
            elements, separating unlike ones.<br>
            I learned a lot!
         </p>

         <h4>What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand Design better?</h4>
         <p>
            I'd really like to spend some more time on colors. Picking out a palette and being effective with using a
            minimal number of colors. Additionally, I think it would be really beneficial to learn how Jacqueline
            interacts
            with clients. Why kind of questions does she ask to end up creating a design that a client will love?
         </p>

         <h4>What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?
         </h4>
         <p>
            Just as in coding, I like purposefully laid out design. I think of design as a first impression, and if it
            makes a bad impression, no matter how useful your site might be, folks won't want to spend time there.<br>
            Additionally, good design enhances and emphasizes the rest of your work. Good design can be perceived
            inherently, and it communicates quality about everything you do.
         </p>

         <h3>In-class Week 2</h3>
         <h4>What did you learn about that helped you understand the Development process?
         </h4>
         <p>
            Plan before you code. Make sure to understand what the requirements are and spend time writing or whiteboarding freely some thoughts about your approach. Use that to help you have a good basis for pseudocoding, and take your time being thorough pseudocoding because it will save you a lot more time on the coding. Once you start coding, check your work often and remember to git add, commit, push! Not straight to master of course. Get the basics done before worrying about the edge cases.
         </p>
         <h4>
            What does it mean to develop good code?
         </h4>
         <p>
            Good code should check several boxes. It should accomplish it's original goal. It should be readable and maintainable. Well organized and commented code goes a long way in helping both others and your future self quickly find what they are looking for. It should be DRY, Don't Repeat Yourself.
            </p>
         <h4>
            What does it mean to be a good Developer?
         </h4>
         <p>
            A good developer keeps in mind the good practices mentioned above as well as their clients interests above their own. If working on a team, a good developer serves their team by keeping up with their work, completing things to the best of their ability, and helping out teammates however they can.
         </p>

         <h3>In-class Week 3</h3>
         <h4>
            Why do you see Javascript useful or hard to use?
         </h4>
         <p>
            I know I'm not the first to say this, and won't be the last, but Javascript is useful because it is so flexible and it is hard to use because it is so flexible.<br>
            My inclination is to want to know the "right" way to do something, and there are best practices, but there are so many possibilities it's often hard to decide where to begin.<br>
            Additionally, it's been fun and challenging to learn the different tools in the Javascript toolbox. Each new HackerRank or project we do, I seem to learn another extremely helpful method.
         </p>
         <h4>
            What aspects about Javascript are you interested in learning more about?
          </h4>
         <p>
            It has been really good to spend time working with vanilla Javascript, and a lifetime could be spent creating with it. I am interested in checking out additional frameworks to see the ways smarter people than me have already harnessed some of it's power.
         </p>

         <h3>Inclass Week 4</h3>
         <h4>
            Why do you see Javascript Frameworks and Libraries useful or hard to use? What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?
         </h4>
         <p>
            They seem to be useful because they give you new ways, and often better ways to solve a problem. They remove a lot of the headache and monotony that you might find in using vanilla Javascript.<br>
            For me, it's similar to learning another dialect of a language. If you already know the standard language, learning a dialect can give you great shorthand ways of saying the same thing. But dialects can sometimes sound and look quite different, so it feels almost like an entirely different language.<br>
            As someone in the early days of learning Javascript, and now React, I can see similarities and connections, but at the moment since I'm still trying refine my Javascript, React often sounds like a totally different language.<br>
            As for Frameworks and Libraries I'm interested in learning, for now my focus is on React. I like the concept but I need to continue to learn the best practices. But right now I'm just trying to be a sponge, so I'm happy to learn about all sorts, jQuery, vue.js, angular...you name it.
         </p>

         <h3>In-class Week 5</h3>
         <h4>
            Why are CLIs scary?
         </h4>
         <p>
            I wouldn't say CLIs are <em>scary</em>, but I suppose they present a challenge to me in that they typically don't offer much visual aid. Imagery and visualizations are very helpful for my comprehension and CLIs tend to be stripped down to just text. I do enjoy the stripped down, simple nature of just putting commands straight into the program to get things done.
         </p>
         <h4>
            What have you learned about CLIs?
         </h4>
         <p>
            Mainly that Command Line Interfaces can be very powerful and lightweight. If I were to make a bike reference to describe CLIs, they are the fixies of the computer world. No extra bells and whistles, just light weight and purpose built to effectively get you from A to B. 
         </p>
         <h4>
            Would you build a CLI? What would it do?
         </h4>
         <p>
            Ask me again a year down the road!
         </p>
