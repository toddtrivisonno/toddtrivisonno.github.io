      <h2>The Overview</h2>
      <p>
         My name is Todd Trivisonno. Each week, I'll be documenting my progress through a web developer bootcamp offered by Awesome Inc. in Lexington, Kentucky. After ten years of working full-time in the outdoor recreation industry, I'm excited to be learning a whole new skillset. Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be able to combine my experience and passion for the outdoors with the tech world.

            I knew the very first week was going to be a difficult one due to a combination of factors. I was still working full-time and in the midst of our busiest season. I learned a great deal in the intro web development class I took in the spring, but since that finished in April I had done a grand total of zero coding. I have three children under the age of 5. And I was (still am?) wrestling with whether I should be quitting my job and jumping into an intimidating new field.
